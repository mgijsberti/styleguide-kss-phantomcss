This project is a POC for creating PhantomCSS test scripts with kss from a Living Stye guide

Installation
===========

In folder test
bower install phantomcss

In root
npm install resemblejs (phantomcss assumes that resemblejs is installed with npm )


Setup baseline
==============

casperjs test test/testsuite.js

In testsuite.js the url is http://localhost:63342/styleguide-poc/styleguide/section-1.html.
The portnumber is created by Intellij (starting the section-1.html from Intellij). So you need to adapt the url.

Baseline is generated in test/screenshots

Change
======

Make a change in the size of font-family in buttons.less
./build.sh (generates the stylesuite)
casperjs test test/testsuite.js

Now you can see the failed screenshots in the /failures folder and in test/screenshots
