This project is a POC for creating PhantomCSS test scripts with kss from a Living Stye guide

Installation
===========
Install the following npm modules with option --saved-dev :
grunt, grunt-concurrent, grunt-contrib-connect, grunt-contrib-less, grunt-contrib-sass, grunt-contrib-watch,
grunt-kss, load-grunt-tasks, grunt-styleguide,

In folder test
bower install phantomcss
npm install bower

In folder styleguide
bower install resemblejs

Start living styleguide
=======================
grunt styleguide

Starts the styleguide on http://localhost:1419. The source files and index.html of the living styleguide are watched.
The styleguide shows the button with different styles. If you change the less files in app/src or the index.html in

Open a new terminal for the comparison of the changes in css. Phantomcss makes screenshot for each element which is
different.

Testing living styleguide
=========================

The first step is to set the baseline. Phantomcss will generate screenshots in the test/report/screenshots folder.

Setup baseline
==============

grunt concurrent:compare_init


Apply a change in the less and check the results:
=================================================

- Change in the app/src/buttons.less the padding attribute of the .btn class:

  padding: 4px 22px; into padding: 4px 52px;

- Wait for reloading of the Living Styleguide.
- Now run

  grunt concurrent:compare

The report with differences will automatically load at http://localhost:1421/. PhantomCss will make new screenshots
for each css element in the markup of the less files, and compare them with the originals. A report will show the
originals, the new (after the applied change), and the differences.

Reinitialize
============

grunt clean:init will reinitialize the validation, all screenshots are removed.

Rebase
======
